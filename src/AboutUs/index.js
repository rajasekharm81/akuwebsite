            The Ongole district name has been changed after the late Chief
            Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Andhra Kesari Tanguturi Prakasam
            Panthulu garu. It is one of the backward districts of Andhra
            Pradesh. The district is not only backward in the sphere of Economy,
            but also backward in the field of education especially in higher
            education.The backwardness can overcome in any field will be
            possible only with the provision of avenues of education. In recent
            times, many educationalists and politicians have put serious efforts
            for the promotion of P.G. Centre for Prakasam District. This long
            lasting efforts materialized only during the reign of Prof.
            Y.C.Simhadri garu, the then Vice-Chancellor. He can be considered
            the Founding Father of the A.N.U. Ongole Campus at Ongole.

            </strong>
            <div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
              <p>
                At present there are six conventional Universities in the State,
                each governed by a separate enactment. These Universities are
                the Andhra University and Nagarjuna University in the Andhra
                Area of the State, Sri Venkateswara University and Sri
                Krishnadevaraya University in the Rayalaseema region, the
                Osmania University and the Kakatiya University in the Telangana
                area of the State.The provisions of the various Universities
                Acts governing the aforesaid Universities are substantially the
                same with minor variations here and there. Whenever there is a
                change in the policy of the Government and an amendment is to be
                effected,it is resulting in the amendment of all the Six
                Universities Acts,which is contributing to legislative
                duplication. Further if any new University is to be
                establishedwith the sameaims and objects,a separate enactment
                has to be passed. To maintain uniformity of law III respect of
                all the conventional Universities and to easily establish any
                conventional University under the same enactment, the Government
                have decided to enact a singlelawin place ofSixUniversities Acts
                and to bring all the aforesaid SixUniversities under new law.
              </p>
              <p>
                Apart from the above aspect of uniformity in the law, the
                ..Govemment have also decided to democratise the functioning of
                the Universities by providing for elected element in the Board
                ofManagement (earlier called as the ExecutiveCouncil) and in the
                Academic Senate: it is also proposed to enlarge themembership of
                the AcademicSenate by drawing persons having rich experience in
                various fields in order to mould the Academic Senate into a
                highly enlightened body.
